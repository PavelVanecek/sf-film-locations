# Download and processing scripts

None of these scripts is used on frontend. Their purpose is to download and transform the data to format friendly to be used in browser.

From performance point of view, there is lot of room for improvement.
I have decided to not pursue that goal, since all of this runs under 10 minutes and I would likely spend more time optimizing than actually running the script.
